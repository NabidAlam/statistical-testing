Project Title: Comparison of Multiple Distributions: Maternal Smoking and Babies' Birth Weight

Introduction:
The "Mothers and their Babies" dataset contains information on 1236 samples of newborns and individual mothers, with 23 independent variables. These variables include infant survival, birth weight, date of birth, sex, mother's ethnicity, age, education level, height, weight, and smoking status. The primary focus of this project is to investigate the relationship between maternal smoking and babies' birth weight and explore whether different smoking conditions lead to changes in the weight of neonates. The dataset can be accessed at https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/statlabs/labs.html, with a clean version provided on Moodle.

Tasks:

1. Descriptive Statistics:
We will use descriptive statistics to provide a brief overview of the distribution of the two variables of interest: babies' birth weight and maternal smoking history. For discrete variables, we will consider the count of data, and for continuous variables, we will examine the distribution and central tendency of different groups.

2. Global Test for Babies' Birth Weights:
To determine if babies' birth weights differ between the categories of maternal smoking history, we will conduct a global test. This test will help us assess whether there are significant differences in birth weights among the different smoking conditions. We will state the null and alternative hypotheses clearly.

3. Pairwise Differences in Birth Weights:
We will perform two-sample tests for all pairs of categories in maternal smoking history to identify pairwise differences in babies' birth weights. To account for multiple comparisons, we will adjust the test results using the Bonferroni correction and Tukey's Honest Significant Difference (HSD) method. Additionally, we will calculate the Tukey's confidence interval to provide further insights into significant differences.

4. Comparison of Correction Methods:
We will compare the results obtained from the Bonferroni correction and Tukey's HSD method with the non-adjusted test. A reasonable explanation will be provided to understand the implications and effectiveness of each correction method.

Assumptions and Significance Levels:
Before applying the respective tests, we will ensure that all assumptions necessary for the tests hold. The significance level for all tests will be set at Î± = 0.05.

Conclusion:
Through the comparison of multiple distributions of maternal smoking and babies' birth weights, this project aims to uncover potential relationships and differences between different smoking conditions and neonatal birth weights. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of how maternal smoking affects newborns and may have implications for maternal and child health.
